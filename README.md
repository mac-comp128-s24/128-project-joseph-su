## Red/Black Tree Visualizer

Red/Black Tree Visualizer is a Java application designed to visualize operations performed on Red-Black Tree data structures. It provides a graphical user interface for users to insert, delete, and visualize tree elements interactively. Additionally, the application supports three different traversal methods: preorder, inorder, and postorder, which allows users to observe the order of visited nodes during each traversal.

### Features

- **Graphical Representation**: This app uses the Macalester Graphics library to visually render the Red-Black Tree on a canvas, giving the user a clear representation of the tree's structure.

- **Interactive Operations**: Users can insert new elements into the tree, delete existing elements, and delete the entire tree with just a few clicks. The GUI interface makes it easy to perform these operations intuitively.

- **Traversal Methods**: This app supports three different traversal methods: preorder, inorder, and postorder. Users can choose one of these methods to observe how nodes are visited in each traversal sequence.

### How to use

1. **Insert**: Enter a numeric value into the text field and click the "Insert" button to add a new element to the Red-Black Tree.

2. **Delete**: Enter the numeric value of the element to be deleted into the text field and click the "Delete" button to remove it from the tree.

3. **Cleanup**: Click the "Delete" button to remove all elements from the Red-Black Tree.

4. **Traversal**: Click the "Preorder", "Inorder", or "Postorder" buttons to perform each traversal method and observe the order of visited nodes.

### Prerequesite

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Macalester Graphics Library

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have installed the required dependencies (JDK, Macalester Graphics).

3. Compile and run the MainUI.java file to launch the Red/Black Tree Visualizer application.

4. Interact with the GUI to perform various operations on the Red-Black Tree and visualize its structure and traversal commands.
